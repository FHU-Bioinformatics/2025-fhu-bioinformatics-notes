# Roadmap

## Step 1 - Geneious Prime Workflow
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Create Geneious Prime workflow that trims ends of sequences and
removes unreliable bases. Then it runs a BLAST search against
the reference species database.

TODO: Consider adding filtering to BLAST result to remove low-quality hits.

## Step 2 - Manual Analysis
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Manually Analyze results to search for relevant data. This process involves
reviewing the BLAST results and identifying any potential interesting results.

TODO: Define a process for analyzing BLAST results and identifying interesting matches or similarities.

## Step 3 - Data Storage
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Manually store data in datastore.
Define a process structuring the data in Google Drive
Define a process for structuring the data in the spreadsheets (one that is more translatable to an RDB)

TODO: Create a document outlining the process for structuring the data in the spreadsheets and Google Drive.

## Step 4 - Mass Analysis Automation
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Automate the provess of running the workflow on folders of barcodes.
Automate the process of analyzing BLAST results and storing data in the datastore.

TODO: Write a python script to automate the process of running the workflow on folders of barcodes

## Step 5 - Web Application for Data access and management
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Develop a web application that allows users to access and manage the stored data.

TODO: Design and develop a web application using FastApi and Next.js that provides an interface
for users to access and manage the stored data.

## Step 6 - Data Visualization and Blast Resutls Analysis Automation
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Automate the process of analyzing BLAST results and storing data in the datastore.

TODO: Write a jupyter notebook to automate the process of analyzing BLAST results and storing data in the datastore

## Step 7 - Integrate Step 4 into Geneious Prime
Created on: May 23, 2025
[ ] Completed
Completed on:

Integrate the automated process created in step 4 into Geneious Prime to streamline the analysis process.

TODO: Develop a plugin for Geneious Prime that integrates the automated process for barcode analysis.
