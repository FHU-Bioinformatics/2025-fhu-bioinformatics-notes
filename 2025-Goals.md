# 2025 Summer Goals

## Roadmap
### Phase 1
Use known values to create a process. Use results to validated
our process.

### Phase 2
Determine "friend from foe." Create a system to filter out
contaminates.

### Phase 3
Apply what we have learned to aDNA. aDNA could have no reference.
So, how do we know that a sequence is what we think it is, not contaminates?
If a sample is sequenced multiple times, and a sequence is
appearing repeatedly, then it is likely that sequence is not a
contaminate and is likely a part of the sample.

# Goals
## Make Sure Data is Organized
May 14, 2025.

Know what files are what and where files are.
Finalize spreadsheet that displays whats in our data sets
and what each barcode is.

## Files Need to be centralized
May 14, 2025.

All data needs to be conglomerated to where all files
are in a remote and local repository. A proposed solution
is having an external ssd that is large to store all the data.

Future iteration is to implement cloud based storage.

## Validate Our Methods
May 14, 2025.

We need to create a method that can be validated with known
genomes to show that our process has authenticity.

## Create a Pipeline that is our Workflow Process
May 14, 2025.

Create a pipeline in Genious Prime in combination with
a script to "unpack" a read to make an analyzable data result.

# Big Picture Goals

## Can we reliably get DNA out of the fossils?
May 22, 2025.
