# April 17 2025 Meeting Takeaways

## Mainly Bioteam Work
### Protein Work
There seems to be datasets made last summer that have still been unused.
There is some protein folding work to be done.
Maybe see if histones can be extracted from the fossils.
### Ancient DNA Work
Some process of contamination control needs to be looked at.
There is a high amount of phosphates which may mean histones could be extracted.

## Bioinformatics Work 

## Data
A spreadsheet needs to be compiled of all the procedures completed to date, and the samples included within them.
Poor-quality read sections can potentially be trimmed using GeniusPrime. However, we need to define the trimming parameters to see what works the best.
Need to compare Kraken 2, Minimap2, and Blast as a way of comparing our 100-200 base pair connections.
Try and establish a pipeline for GeniusPrime whenever the money aspect is dealt with.

## Team Stuff
**Megan Lampley** and **Brayden Smith** will serve as the main bridge and feedback between the informatics and biology teams. They'll help us see how effective the system/pipeline we make will be.
We'll be doing **RCR** training (Responsible Conduct of Research) fairly soon.
