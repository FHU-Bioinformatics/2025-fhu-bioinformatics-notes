# May 8, 2025 Meeting

## What are the tools we need?

- Genious Prime
  Multiple licenses will be purchased for the purpose of devlopment

- Nothing else for now. Possibility for hardware in the future.

## The ecosystem of tools

What is the workflow and the peices involved?
  It is in the process of being documented.

- Spreadsheet for files and dataset relations

What does the workflow look like?
  The workflow will get built as we go along.
  Everything needs to get documented and structured so that
  we can go back to any x and extrapolate the data. This is
  a long term project so structure is neccessary.

Consider looking at how the Neandrothol genome was put together.

## Desire to hash out goals

We need to sit down with Dr. Deweese and hash out what our goals are
and create a roadmap to get there.

Meeting Wednesday the 14th to discuss the meetings.
