# April 8 2025 Meeting Takeaways

## Minimap2

Minimap2 uses kmere as well. That will not be an effective
solution for the framented data. A software called geneious
has been tested, but requires lots of tedious work for the
amount of files involved. It is also costly. 600 per year.

## Geneious Prime

A desire for a script to make the geneious workflow easier is expressed.
The script could potentially extrapolate all scans into one folder for geneious
analysis.

Geneious Prime also allows for native scripting in the Java language and has A
CLI tool that could be used in something like a bash or python script.

Look at secondary settings in geneious:
- Override k-mere length
- minimum alignment
- Some other 3rd but I missed It

## Other Notes

The problems related in a previous email about minKnow were solved.

In epi2me, provide a way to see what the genome matches are. It is
a desire to research if epi2me has a way to tweak the workflow to
see the matched genomes.

However, in Geneious Prime, this functionanlity already exists.


## Actionables

- Think on these things
- Work on project management tooling (setting it up)
- Dig in on Geneious Workflow.
